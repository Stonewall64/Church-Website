# Church Website Information

This repository is a basic template that churches can use when creating a website. Please feel free to utilize this project for your church. I only ask that you credit my Github if you use it. Below is some basic information regarding the contents of this repository, including pages, descriptions of the pages, and future work. 

## Current Project Pages:
This repo has six pages. Home, About, Ministries, Sermons, Contact Us, and Giving. 

### Home:
The main screen of the website. This page has a welcome message, with some pictures of the church and/or services that are a slideshow. A church news section is included as well for current and future events. 

### About:
Contains basic information about the church. This includes a short history of the church, the current staff, and service information. 

### Ministries:
The current ministires offered at the church are listed here. For a placeholder, a food pantry, bus ministry, and nursing home visititation are listed with a brief summary of each. 

### Contact Us:
The church phone number is listed along with a Google Forms that will email the respone to a specified email address. 

### Sermons
A YouTube link is included that will direct vistors to a specified sermon series. I recommend adding sermons into folders on your YouTube page and having a static link to that folder. The current series title is also added with the previous sermon Scriptures

### Giving:
A tithe.ly link to be linked to your church's bank account for online giving. 




## Future Plans:
My future plans are to improve the appearance of the website. It is a functional website in that it displays information as it is designed to. An admin page will be added in the future for an admin to modify some aspects of the website instead of having to push code changes. A calendar of events will be added later and will be one of the sections the church admin can edit without having to modify the code.
